// asynchronus js
// helps in network calls 
// it sort of a technique by which we can execute some parts separatly while running the other part

 
// this part is executed after 4 seconds  of setTimeOut is called 
setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log("Neetesh Parihar") 
} , 4000)  ;

console.log("hello neetesh") ;



// event loop in js

// there are some task that js cannot execute so it passes the task to the environment like browser or nodejs
